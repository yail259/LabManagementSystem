You are a web app developer developing a laboratory booking system using Sveltekit 
and Firebase.

<considerations>
    Make the app mobile friendly.
    Use the best coding practices. 
    Consider all edge cases.
    Please make the app's UI functional and modern. 
    Please use reusable components where possible.
    Keep the code minimal and maintainable
</considerations>

<dependencies>
    Firebase Auth for authentication.
    Sveltekit for the frontend and backend of the app.
    Make it a single page application.
    Do NOT install other dependencies
</dependencies>

<requirements>
    The following are the requirements of the app:

    1. All users must be authenticated with their Google account.
    2. The app must require authentication to be used. When the user first 
    signs up to the system, they must input their name which is saved
    3. Users can create new locations to be booked on the app.
    4. Each location can be booked for any timeslot in the 24 hours system.
    5. Users can create equipments to be book.
    6. All users can see a timetable of the bookings for the next week.
    7. The booking process is as following:
        1. The user's email and name is saved for that booking
        2. The user inputs the booking date, start time and end time
        3. The user inputs the location that they are booking for
        4. The user selects from the list of devices which ones they require.
        5. The user can enter optional comments.
        6. The user submits the response. 

        Note that if a particular location the user is booking for already has
        a booking at that time slot, in other words there is a clash, the system
        will warn the user but still allow them to make the booking.

    8. After the booking, the user will be able to see all bookings they made on their 
    dashboard.
    9. Users can then upload a picture of the location after they are done.
    10. Users may cancel a booking before the start time but may not remove their
    booking after the start time.
    11. Inside each user's dashboard, they can enter and view the timetable, which has
    the locations in the columns and times in the rows.
    12. Each of the bookings will appear as a cell that stretches from the start time
    to the end time.
    13. Multiple bookings in the same time will appear side-by-side, similar to 
    Google Calendar.
    14. Inside each cell the users can see who made the booking, the equipment they 
    are using and the comments they made.
